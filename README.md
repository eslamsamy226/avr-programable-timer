# AVR Programable Timer
This is a simple timer uses AVR architecture allowing users to set a time and counts down untill it reachs zero then turns on the buzzer and led, the user can then return the timer to it's defualt state and reprogram it.

## ⚡Components
 The following components have been used:
 * ATMEGA32 MCU
 * LED
 * Buzzer
 * 7-segment
 * Push buttons

## 🛠️Drivers
In order to achive the project funtionality I wrote the following drivers:
* DIO
* Buzzer
* Led
* 7-segment
these drivers can be found in /src forlder

## 👨‍💻Simulation
The proteus simulation design can be found in (Design.DSN) file, here is the simulation in action:
